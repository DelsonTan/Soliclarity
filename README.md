## General Info
This app is designed to be a one-stop location for students to collaborate on keeping track of all academic events during the course of their school term. Users are able to join courses with their classmates and academic events describing assignment deadlines, exam times and other time-sensitive events created by a user will be shared across all users in the course, reducing the individual effort needed to keep track of every important date and providing a safety net against missing the information.
